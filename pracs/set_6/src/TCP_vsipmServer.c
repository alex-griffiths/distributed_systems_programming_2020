/*
 * 300115 Distributed Systems and Programming: TCP_vsipmServer.c
 *
 * Compile with: cc TCP_vsipmServer.c -o lec3_server
 *
 * A simple concurrent connection orientated server.
 * Will work with telnet as a client.
 *
 * You should specify the server port number as the last four digits of your
 * student number (as long as it is above 1024 add 1024 if it is not). This should
 * minimise server port number clases with other students sharing the machine.
 *
 * Note: there is minimal error checking in this example, in order to improve 
 * its readability. Production quality code would be filled with error
 * checking and recovery code to make it as robust as possible. Real code
 * doesn't "bail out" at the first sign of an error.
